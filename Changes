Revision history for {{$dist->name}}

{{$NEXT}}
    - line numbers in shipped code are now almost the same (within 3) as the
      repository source, for easier debugging
    - Changes content once again included manually, rather than extracted
      directly from git! (there are release tests to ensure that the file is
      kept current.)
