1.39      2015-06-10 04:37:49Z
    - mark this distribution as deprecated in metadata
    - drop dependency on namespace::clean

1.38      2014-09-29 16:42:08Z
    - real fix to tests from 1.37

1.37      2014-09-29 16:29:44Z
    - fix tests to use a higher precedence operator, to avoid confusing newer
      Test::More::cmp_ok.

1.36      2014-08-26 05:54:35Z
    - many improvements to tests and their coverage
    - $ENV{JSON_ANY_CONFIG} can no longer override constructor arguments

1.35      2014-08-16 00:51:05Z
    - clarify deprecation status in documentation

1.34      2014-05-28 21:31:20Z
    - remove test dependency on Devel::StringInfo, which requires Moose
      (RT#96034)

1.33      2014-04-19 05:58:46Z
    - line numbers in shipped code are now almost the same (within 3) as the
      repository source, for easier debugging
    - Changes content once again included manually, rather than extracted
      directly from git! (there are release tests to ensure that the file is
      kept current.)
    - Improve error message when failing to find a suitable backend (RT#87751)
    - when no backend is available at install time, JSON::PP is used as the
      default prereq rather than JSON.pm (re RT#67967)
    - documentation updated to recommend JSON::MaybeXS instead of JSON.pm for
      new code
