need to figure out how to Test::Without::Module JSON::XS for the JSON backend in:
[] t/10_unicode.t 
[] t/11-string-escape.t
[] t/12-boolean.t

make sure all tests pass with JSON < 2.90 && JSON::XS >= 3.0

I've found using pm-uninstall and cpanm to tweak my local::lib to have the right versions works. 
You need to pm-uninstall both of them incase they're installed, then `cpanm JSON@2.61` before `cpanm JSON::XS`
